{"name":"Bootstrap Listr","tagline":"","body":"A simple PHP script to display folders and files on a server in a well formed list, making use of the [Bootstrap 3.2](http://getbootstrap.com) framework.\r\n\r\n*Watch a [live demo](http://demo.idleberg.com/Bootstrap-Listr)!*\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nDownload the latest [stable release](https://github.com/idleberg/Bootstrap-Listr/releases) or clone the repository for the latest development version.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nLike its [predecessors](#credtis), Bootstrap Listr was meant as *one file to rule them all*, an easy to deploy single file solution. Since it does not support subfolders, you will have to copy the index in every directory where you would like to use it.\r\n\r\nOr, you can have a go at the [2.0 developer branch](https://github.com/idleberg/Bootstrap-Listr/tree/2.0-dev). While it is no longer a single file, it's easy to deploy and features subfolder support among other things. See it in this [live demo](http://demo.idleberg.com/Bootstrap-Listr-2.0-dev/).\r\n\r\n### Options\r\n\r\nYou can configure a number of settings in the header of the script file:\r\n\r\n* Optional columns for size, modified date, permissions\r\n* Document icons\r\n* Column sorting\r\n* Responsive tables\r\n* List of ignored files\r\n* Default location for JavaScript libraries and style sheets\r\n* Google Analytics\r\n\r\n### Naming\r\n\r\nIf you prefer a different file name for the script, you can rename it without worrying about the ignore list. However, depending on your server, you might have declare the renamed file as your directory index.\r\n\r\n* Apache: `DirectoryIndex myIndex.php` (see [documentation](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_dir.html))\r\n* lighttpd: `index-file.names = ( \"/myIndex.php\" )` (see [documentation](http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/1/wiki/Docs_ModDirlisting))\r\n* nginx: `index myIndex.php` (see [documentation](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_index_module.html))\r\n\r\n\r\n### Font Awesome\r\n\r\nRather than using generic icons, you can enable [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) for beautiful, file-specific icons. Note that this will require extra resources, hence increase the load time.\r\n\r\n### Theming\r\n\r\nShould you decide to use [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/) (or any other) themes, please note that some of these do not include the [glyphicons](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons) used in the script. You can disable glyphicons in the script header or use Font Awesome icons instead.\r\n\r\n### Viewer\r\n\r\nTo load images, videos and audio into a [Bootstrap Modal](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals), you can enable the viewer in the script header. The required Bootstrap JavaScript library will be added to your page automatically.\r\n\r\n### Libraries & Style-sheets\r\n\r\nFor your convenience, CDNs for Bootstrap and JQuery. Should you have reasons against this, you can change the default locations in the script header.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nThis project is built upon—or includes—code from the following people:\r\n\r\n* Greg Johnson - [PHPDL lite](http://web.archive.org/web/20130920165711/http://greg-j.com/phpdl/) [Internet Archive]\r\n* Na Wong - [Listr](http://nadesign.net/listr/)\r\n* Joe McCullough - [Stupid Table Plugin](http://joequery.github.io/Stupid-Table-Plugin/)\r\n\r\nThanks to [melalj](https://github.com/melalj) and [Zerquix18](https://github.com/Zerquix18) for contributing code to make this project better!\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis work by Jan T.
