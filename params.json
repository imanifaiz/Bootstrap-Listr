{"name":"Bootstrap Listr","tagline":"pretty folder views","body":"# Bootstrap Listr\r\n\r\nA simple PHP script to display folders and files on a server in a well formed list, making use of the [Bootstrap 3.1](http://getbootstrap.com) framework.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://raw.github.com/idleberg/Bootstrap-Listr/gh-pages/images/screenshot-font_awesome.png)  \r\n*Screenshot: Example with [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) icons enabled*\r\n\r\nFor examples using different configurations, have a look at the [live demos](http://demo.idleberg.com/Bootstrap-Listr)!\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### GitHub ###\r\n\r\nClone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/idleberg/Bootstrap-Listr` or [`download`](https://raw.github.com/idleberg/Bootstrap-Listr/master/index.php) the raw file.\r\n\r\n### robots.txt ###\r\n\r\nThe basic file you're after is `index.php`, but the repository also comes with a restrictive `robots.txt` file. Should you wish your page to be indexed by web crawlers et al, you can delete the file or adjust its [settings](http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html).\r\n\r\nAlso note that by default, `index.php` has `robots.txt` on its ignore-list, meaning the file will be hidden in the view.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nI am unaware of a method to use one index file for several directories at once (feel free to correct me!), hence you will have to copy the index in every directory where you would like to use it. Since Bootstrap Listr is a one-file solution, doing so is relatively easy.\r\n\r\n### Options\r\n\r\nYou can configure a number of settings in the header of the script file:\r\n\r\n* Optional columns for size, modified date, permissions\r\n* Document icons\r\n* Column sorting\r\n* Responsive tables\r\n* List of ignored files\r\n* Default location for JavaScript libraries and style sheets\r\n* Google Analytics\r\n\r\n### Naming\r\n\r\nIf you prefer a different file name for the script, you can rename it without worrying about the ignore list. However, depending on your server, you might have declare the renamed file as your directory index.\r\n\r\n* Apache: `DirectoryIndex myIndex.php` (see [documentation](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_dir.html))\r\n* lighttpd: `index-file.names = ( \"/myIndex.php\" )` (see [documentation](http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/1/wiki/Docs_ModDirlisting))\r\n* nginx: `index myIndex.php` (see [documentation](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_index_module.html))\r\n\r\n### Font Awesome\r\n\r\nRather than using generic icons, you can enable [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) for beautiful, file-specific icons. Note that this will require extra resources, hence increase the load time.\r\n\r\n### Theming\r\n\r\nShould you decide to use [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/) (or any other) themes, please note that some of these do not include the [glyphicons](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons) used in the script. You can disable glyphicons in the script header or use Font Awesome icons instead.\r\n\r\n### Libraries & Style-sheets\r\n\r\nFor your convenience, we use CDNs for Bootstrap and JQuery. Should you have reasons against this, you can change the default locations in the script header.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nThis project is built upon—or includes—code from the following people:\r\n\r\n* Greg Johnson - [PHPDL lite](http://web.archive.org/web/20130920165711/http://greg-j.com/phpdl/) [Internet Archive]\r\n* Na Wong - [Listr](http://nadesign.net/listr/)\r\n* Joe McCullough - [Stupid Table Plugin](http://joequery.github.io/Stupid-Table-Plugin/)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis work by Jan T.
