{"name":"Bootstrap Listr","tagline":"","body":"# Bootstrap Listr\r\n\r\nA replacement for default server indexes, Bootstrap Listr beautifully displays folders and files in the browser. It is built upon the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) framework and optionally makes use of [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/) themes and [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) icons.\r\n\r\n*Watch a [live demo](http://demo.idleberg.com/Bootstrap-Listr-2.0-dev/)!*\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/idleberg/Bootstrap-Listr.git` \r\n2. Change directory `cd Bootstrap-Listr`\r\n3. Install all Node dependencies `npm install`\r\n\r\n## Building\r\n\r\nIf you're already overwhelmed by the idea of having to build stuff, or simply wonder what happened to the old one-file solution—get the old version [here](https://github.com/idleberg/Bootstrap-Listr/tree/1.0-dev/)!\r\n\r\n### Local\r\n\r\n[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) tasks are used to configure and build your app. You can install Gulp globally using `npm install gulp -g`. For your convenience, `setup.sh` is provided to run all setup tasks. Alternatively, you can run Gulp tasks manually:\r\n\r\n    # create and populate app-folder\r\n    gulp init\r\n\r\n    # choose default theme (optional)\r\n    gulp bootstrap\r\n\r\n    # enable the Viewer modal (optional)\r\n    gulp viewer\r\n\r\n    # enable the Search Box (optional)\r\n    gulp search\r\n\r\n    # enable Font Awesome icons (optional)\r\n    gulp icons\r\n\r\n    # enable syntax highlighting (optional)\r\n    gulp highlighter\r\n\r\n    # minify CSS, uglify JS\r\n    gulp make\r\n\r\nFor a full list of available commands, type `gulp help`.\r\n\r\n### CDN\r\n\r\nInstead of running your dependencies locally, you can make use of various content delivery networks (CDN). Initialize your app using `gulp init` and set `dependencies` to `cdn` in your `config.json`. You can then specify your preferred CDNs (and all other preferences) in this file as well (see [below](#options) for details!)\r\n\r\n## Deployment\r\n\r\nCopy `app/` to your server, then rename `config.json-example` to `config.json` and edit your settings. All files that should be accessible in the browser go into the `_public` folder (you can change the folder in the config). Depending on your Apache settings, you might have to uncomment the `RewriteBase` setting in the `.htaccess` file (maybe add parent folder name after the slash.)\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n\r\nYou can configure a number of settings in the file `config.json`:\r\n\r\n* Optional columns for size, modified date, permissions\r\n* Document icons\r\n* File viewer for images, videos, audio and source code\r\n* Search box to filter results\r\n* Column sorting\r\n* Responsive tables\r\n* List of ignored files\r\n* Default location for JavaScript libraries and style sheets\r\n* Syntax highlighting in file viewer\r\n* Save to Dropbox\r\n* Share buttons\r\n* Google Analytics\r\n\r\n### Font Awesome\r\n\r\nRather than using the default [Bootstrap Glyphicons](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons), you can enable [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) for beautiful, file-specific icons. Note that this will require extra resources, hence increase the load time.\r\n\r\n### Theming\r\n\r\nYou can overwrite the `default` Bootstrap with any [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/) theme (e.g. `united`) or add your `custom_theme` in the CDN settings. Please note that Bootswatch themes do not include [glyphicons](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons).\r\n\r\n### Viewer\r\n\r\nTo load images, videos, audio and source code into a [Bootstrap Modal](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals), the viewer is enabled by default. You can change this in `config.json`. The required Bootstrap JavaScript library will be added to your page automatically.\r\n\r\n### Search Box\r\n\r\nTo filter files and folders displayed in the table, set `enable_search` to `true`. Additionally, you can enable `autofocus_search` set the focus to the search box on load.\r\n\r\n### Syntax Highlighter\r\n\r\nSource code in the viewer modal can be highlighted using [highlight.js](http://highlightjs.org/). Due to performance concerns when applied on huge files, the highlighter will only apply once the button at the bottom of the viewer modal is pressed.\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\n\r\n1.
