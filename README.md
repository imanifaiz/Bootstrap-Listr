# Bootstrap Listr

[![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/idleberg%2FBootstrap-Listr.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/gh/idleberg%2FBootstrap-Listr) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/idleberg/Bootstrap-Listr.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/idleberg/Bootstrap-Listr) [![devDependencies](https://david-dm.org/idleberg/Bootstrap-Listr/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/idleberg/Bootstrap-Listr#info=devDependencies)

A replacement for default server indexes, Bootstrap Listr beautifully displays folders and files in the browser. It is built upon the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) framework and optionally makes use of [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/) themes and [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) icons.

*Watch a [live demo](http://demo.idleberg.com/Bootstrap-Listr-2.0-dev/)!*

## Installation

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/idleberg/Bootstrap-Listr.git` 
2. Change directory `cd Bootstrap-Listr`
3. Install all Node dependencies `npm install`

## Building

If you're already overwhelmed by the idea of having to build stuff, or simply wonder what happened to the old one-file solution—get the old version [here](https://github.com/idleberg/Bootstrap-Listr/tree/1.0-dev/)!

### Gulp

[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) tasks are used to configure and build your app. You can install Gulp globally using `npm install gulp -g`. 

Alternatively, you can run Gulp tasks manually:

1. Use `gulp init` to copy base files (or use `gulp upgrade` to preserve an existing setup)
2. Setup the application using `gulp setup`

To change the default highlighter.js theme, you can run `gulp hljs`. Just make sure you haven't merged your assets prior to this. You can merge your assets afterwards using `gulp merge`.

For your convenience, you can also run `setup.sh` to install all Node packages and the setup tasks.

### CDN

Instead of running your dependencies locally, you can make use of various content delivery networks (CDN). Initialize your app using `gulp init` and set `dependencies` to `cdn` in your `config.json`. You can then specify your preferred CDNs (and all other preferences) in this file as well (see [below](#options) for details!)

## Deployment

Copy `app/` to your server, then rename `config.json-example` to `config.json` and edit your settings. All files that should be accessible in the browser go into the `_public` folder (you can change the folder in the config). Depending on your Apache settings, you might have to uncomment the `RewriteBase` setting in the `.htaccess` file (maybe add parent folder name after the slash.)

## Options

You can configure a number of settings in the file `config.json`:

* Optional columns for size, modified date, permissions
* Document icons
* File viewer for images, videos, audio and source code
* Search box to filter results
* Column sorting
* Responsive tables
* List of ignored files
* Default location for JavaScript libraries and style sheets
* Syntax highlighting in file viewer
* Save to Dropbox
* Share buttons
* Google Analytics
* Language

### Font Awesome

Rather than using the default [Bootstrap Glyphicons](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons), you can enable [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) for beautiful, file-specific icons. Note that this will require extra resources, hence increase the load time.

### Theming

You can overwrite the `default` Bootstrap style with any [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/) theme (e.g. `united`) or add a custom style-sheet in the asset settings. Please note that Bootswatch themes do not include [glyphicons](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons).

### Viewer

To load images, videos, audio and source code into a [Bootstrap Modal](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals), the viewer is enabled by default. You can change this in `config.json`. The required Bootstrap JavaScript library will be added to your page automatically.

### Search Box

To filter files and folders displayed in the table, set `enable_search` to `true`. Additionally, you can enable `autofocus_search` set the focus to the search box on load.

### Syntax Highlighter

Source code in the viewer modal can be highlighted using [highlight.js](http://highlightjs.org/). Due to performance concerns when applied on huge files, the highlighter will only apply once the button at the bottom of the viewer modal is pressed.

### Language

Several languages are supported as of alpha 4, you can specify your preferred language in `config.json`. Currently supported are French (`fr_FR`), German (`de_DE`), Portuguese (`pt_PT`) and Spanish (`es_ES`).
